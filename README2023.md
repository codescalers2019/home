### Onboarding and daily workflow

- Each send their handle on telegram group to get permissions on the repo
- Each create an issue on home repo in the format of `INTERNSHIP-$NAME` e.g `INTERNSHIP-omnia`
  - the issue describes the progress (exact copy of the track file with checkeboxes), there needs to be daily updates using comments
- For every project in the internship, the intern should create a repo in the format of `$projectname-$internname` e.g `iniparser-ahmed`
- Every intern is expected to deliver at least [2 sessions](./sessionsideas.md) with presentations to the rest of the team during the whole internship
- There's daily work section to work on "daily" along with the weekly plan
